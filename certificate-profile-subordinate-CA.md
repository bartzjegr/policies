| subjectInfoAccess  | Conditional | False |  **Conditional:** <br>1) **Not present** if the subject CA only issues subscriber certificates <br>2) **Mandatory** if the subject CA issues subordinate CA certificates <br><br> id-ad-caRepository (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.5):<br> At least one instance of this access method that includes the URI name form to specify the location of an HTTP accessible location where CA certificates issued by the subject of this certificate may be found. The certificate artifact(s) served by the HTTP accessible location shall be in a BER or DER encoded "certs-only" CMS message as specified in [RFC5752]. This extension is required to assist in monitoring and discovery of, and promote transparency for, the Subordinate CAs. |
