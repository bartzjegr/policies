# Providing Feedback

**Review the documentation.** No account is needed to review. Simply follow [this link](https://github.com/uspki/policies) and enjoy at your leisure. However, if you wish to comment or submit changes via a pull request you must…

1. **Establish a GitHub account.** In order to submit a comment through the GitHub “Issues” feature, you will need to create a GitHub account. This can be done by proceeding to https://github.com/join. GitHub allows you to remain pseudonymous if you would like, just make sure you select the options that suit you on the “Profile” and “Emails” pages of your “Personal Settings”.  We also highly encourage you to turn on two-factor authentication in the “Security” page, also part of “Personal Settings”.

2. **Open an issue.** As you are reading and identify comments you would like to make:

    1. Click on the Issues tab.

    2. Review open and closed issues to determine if a similar issue has already been created.

    3. Click on the "New Issue" button in the upper right of the screen.

If you are familiar with GitHub, you are also welcome to provide changes as a pull request.  

We request that changes be submitted separately by Section (Section 1 and 1.1, Section 2 and 2.1, etc) to help encourage discussion on individual sections and direct changes.
