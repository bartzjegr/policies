The browser community, commercial trust stores, and standards development organizations have rapidly been defining and adopting emerging technology requirements for the public Internet and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS).  These requirements are intended to protect consumers, protect website operators from spoofing incidents, and promote an open and transparent trust model across the globe.   These requirements include:

- Requiring Certificate Transparency (CT) starting in April 2018
- Requiring increasingly shorter lifetimes of the validity of certificates used for publicly trusted web services
- Public disclosure of all certificate policies, practices and procedures by all Certificate Authorities

The U.S. Government currently manages the Federal Public Key Infrastructure, a trust framework of over 100 certification authorities used to issue and manage person identity and enterprise device identity certificates for U.S. Federal Government and mission partners. The current Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) needs to be expanded and revisited to:

- address the emerging requirements,
- enable automation for the missions, and
- remove dependencies between the infrastructures for person identity, government enterprise device identity, code signing, time stamping and public trust (Internet) web services.
