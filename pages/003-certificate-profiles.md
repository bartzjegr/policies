# Certificate Profiles
Note: These profiles are in draft and will be added as an Appendix to the Certificate Policy.  In cases where the profiles and Section 7 of the Certificate Policy are in conflict, Section 7 takes precedence and is authoritative. 

Four certificate profiles covered by this CP are outlined.  

- [Self-Signed Root CA Certificate Profile](/certificate-profile-root-CA.md)
- [Intermediate or Subordinate CA Certificate Profile](/certificate-profile-subordinate-CA.md)
- [Server Authentication Certificate Profile](/certificate-profile-server-authentication.md)
- [Delegated OCSP Responder Certificate Profile](/certificate-profile-OCSP-responder.md)

In addition, there are two profiles covering the OCSP _Responses_ and the Certificate Revocation Lists.

- [OCSP Response Profile](/ocsp-response-profile.md)
- [CRL Profile](/crl-profile.md)
