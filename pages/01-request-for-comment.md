**Key questions:**

1. The Certificate Policy and architecture proposes a clear separation of certificates used to secure government enterprise (non-public) services and certificate for public trust

2. Certificate Transparency is required in the proposed Certificate Policy and architecture.  Are the requirements and policy statements for certificate transparency clear and accurate?
